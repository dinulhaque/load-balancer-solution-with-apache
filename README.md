> The whole essence is basically to distribute the traffic load. Imagine if only one server is dedicated to handle requests from 1 million users? What if the requests increase even more, to maybe 10 million. That would be a horrific experience if just one server is responding to all of these requests. No matter the size of the compute power, there is a maximum limit to how you can scale the server vertically.To solve this problem, it is better to scale the servers horizontally (By adding more servers).
